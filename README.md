# A Ruby gem to parse INI files

A while ago (notice the date & tool of the first commit) I needed a way to parse INI files in a Ruby tool.

The library was supposed to read & and write INI files. In particular I wanted the tool to _keep_ any comments in a _read_ INI file in place with the following setting.

Therefore: ini_file.rb

It' not (yet?) a Ruby gem, but may still be useful for folks.
